# HereNow backend 

This application is formerly known as `PresenceBackend`.

It is the backend for a proprietary application that is built for the single purpose of managing the presence of specific people in a public location. 
Its main focus is the tracking for insurance and responsibility purposes. 

Please note, that this application is not built for the wide use and is only designed to run with a small amount of data within a very specific environment.


## Installation

We prefer docker for the setup. You just need to modify the compose file for your purposes.
